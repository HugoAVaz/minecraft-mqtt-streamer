Each action increments a counter for a specific event, such as crafting, building, or receiving damage, providing a real-time overview of player activities on the server.\n\nThese counters follow the Unified Namespace (UNS) convention, with event topics triggering updates to corresponding status topics. For example, an event on `server/players/+/events/craft` will increment the counter on `server/players/+/status/craft/counter`.\n\nTo use these counters, ensure that this notebook is loaded into a LOT-compatible MQTT broker that is subscribed to the event topics published by the Minecraft plugin."
